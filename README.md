# A little insight into Sarah Guthals
Hi Everyone! My name is Sarah Guthals and I am the author of `GitHub for Dummies`. This README will give you a bit of information about me!

## My Career Passions
I really love working in tech. Specifically, I love being in a position where I can help others build something amazing! Whether that's being a manager, or working with customers and relaying that information back to the developers, that is my sweet spot! I enjoy teaching and learning, so any role that enables me to flex my education muscles is the right role for me, that's why I really enjoy writing these books!

## My Hobbies
One of my favorite things to do is go to Disneyland - even if I didn't go on any rides, just walking around the park and feeling the magic is enough for me :smile:
