# A little insight into Sarah Guthals
Hi Everyone! My name is Sarah Guthals and I am the author of `GitHub for Dummies`. This README will give you a bit of information about me!

## My Career Passions
I really love working in tech. Specifically, I love being in a position where I can help others build something amazing! Whether that's being a manager, or working with customers and relaying that information back to the developers, that is my sweet spot! I enjoy teaching and learning, so any role that enables me to flex my education muscles is the right role for me, that's why I really enjoy writing these books!

## My Hobbies
One of my favorite things to do is go to Disneyland - even if I didn't go on any rides, just walking around the park and feeling the magic is enough for me :smile:

## My Favorite Books
I absolutely LOVE the Harry Potter books, they are so engaging and rich. What is even better is the community that has formed around it. Lately, I've been listening to podcasts that do deep dives into the entire Harry Potter universe and it is so much fun!
